  * The index is huuuuge ! How can I make it smaller ?
    The format of Xapian indexes is optimized for writing. Once all documents
    have been indexed, compacting the index may reduce its size quite
    significantly. If you have Xapian >= 1.0.6, xapian-compact will let you do
    that. Stop the daemon and run the following commands :
     $ mv ~/.pinot/daemon ~/.pinot/backup-daemon
     $ xapian-compact ~/.pinot/backup-daemon ~/.pinot/daemon
    This may take a little while. Once xapian-compact has completed, restart
    the daemon with :
     $ pinot-dbus-daemon -i
    The -i parameter instructs the daemon to ignore the index version number,
    which may not have been set in the compacted index.
    You may also want to disable support for spelling and enable stopwords
    removal. See the README for more details.

  * Memory usage is too high ! How can I reduce it ?
    Since 0.92, Pinot hints at the OS that it can reclaim unused memory on a
    regular basis. This works on Linux but maybe not on other OSes.
    If your system is memory constrained, you can :
    - increase the frequency at which memory is returned to the OS by setting
      MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_ to a value lower than 128kb (the default) :
      $ export MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_=65536
    - reduce the number of documents Xapian buffers in memory before changes
      are flushed to the disk (default is 10000) :
      $ export XAPIAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD=1000
    Note that the daemon explicitely flushes the index once it has crawled one
    of the directory configured in Preferences.
    If the above doesn't help and there is a large number of big documents to
    index, you may want to configure Pinot to index your corpus in stages.

  * Pinot doesn't use my favourite browser XYZ to open HTML documents
    Even if you have set XYZ as your favourite Web browser in your desktop
    environment, it may not be setup as the default application for HTML files.
    In Gnome for instance, one has to select XYZ as default for all HTML files
    using Nautilus (Properties dialog, Open With tab). This applies to
    applications for any other file type.

  * At startup, when listing an index or indexing documents, Pinot complains
    of an "index error"
    This is likely because a previous instance didn't exit properly and one
    (or more) index is still locked. Quit Pinot and look for a "db_lock",
    "flicklock" or "flintlock" file (depending on what version of Xapian the
    index was created with/is currently installed) in the directory that Pinot
    complains about. If it's there, check that no other process is using this
    file, delete it and restart Pinot.

  * When compiling from source, you may run into linking problems related to
    libstdc++.la. Try patching xapian-config as explained in the post at
    http://lists.tartarus.org/pipermail/xapian-devel/2006-January/000293.html

  * If you experience segfaults at startup and you are on Fedora, chances are
    it's because of libxml++/libsigc++. See this Bugzilla entry :
    https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=178592
    The latest version seems to fix this issue.

  * If the daemon crashes with a backtrace pointing at boost::pool_allocator<>,
    rebuild with the configure option "--enable-mempool=no".

  * If the daemon crashes seemingly randomly while indexing, it may be because
    SQLite wasn't built thread-safe. I have witnessed this mostly on dual CPU
    machines, but others are not immune. Try rebuilding SQLite by passing
    "--enable-threadsafe --enable-threads-override-locks" to configure.

  * If you have built Pinot from source, make sure you have done a "make install".
    Pinot will fail to start if it can't find stuff it needs, its icon for
    instance.

  * If "make install" fails with an error about Categories in pinot.desktop
    and you have desktop-file-utils 0.11, either downgrade to 0.10 or upgrade
    to 0.12 if possible, or edit the top-level Makefile and replace the line
     @desktop-file-install --vendor="" --dir=$(DESTDIR)$(datadir)/applications pinot.desktop
    with
     $(INSTALL_DATA) pinot.desktop $(DESTDIR)$(datadir)/applications/pinot.desktop
    and run "make install" again.

  * In stored queries, the directory filter doesn't work as expected if the
    directory name starts with a non alpha-numeric character. This has been
    fixed in Xapian 0.9.8.

  * On FreeBSD, threading issues may cause the daemon to crash unexpectedly.
    A fix is to add the following lines to /etc/libmap.conf (which may not exist) :
     [/usr/local/bin/pinot-dbus-daemon]
     libpthread.so.2         libc_r.so.6
     libpthread.so           libc_r.so

     [/usr/local/bin/pinot]
     libpthread.so.2         libc_r.so.6
     libpthread.so           libc_r.so

  * If you are using KDE 3.* and pinot-dbus-daemon does not autostart, symlink
    the file /etc/xdg/autostart/pinot-dbus-daemon.desktop to either
    $(kde-config --prefix)/share/autostart (for all users) or ~/.kde/Autostart
    (current user only).
